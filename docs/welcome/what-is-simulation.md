# What Is SIMULATION?

SIMULATION is an AI-adjudicated synthetic prediction market platform on Solana. Players stake SOL on AI-generated scenarios where outcomes are determined by the protocol — not external oracles.

## How It Works

1. An AI generates a scenario or hides a secret answer
2. Players stake SOL and interact with the round (arguments, questions, guesses)
3. The protocol resolves the outcome on-chain
4. Payouts are distributed automatically via PDA escrow

All funds are held in program-owned accounts. No wallet — including the backend — has custody of player deposits.

## What You Can Do

- **Play [Alon's Box](../games/alons-box/overview.md)** — A guessing game where an AI hides a two-word phrase and players compete to identify it
- **Explore the [SSE Protocol](../protocol/overview.md)** — Understand how Simulated Synthetic Events work
- **Build on SIMULATION** — See the [developer docs](../developers/architecture.md) for smart contract integration

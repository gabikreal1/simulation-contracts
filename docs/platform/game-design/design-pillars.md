# Design Pillars

Five core pillars guide the design of every game and system in the SSE ecosystem.

## 1. From Spectator to Co-Author

Players must feel their action matters. In traditional prediction markets, users are passive bettors waiting for external outcomes. In SSE, player actions directly influence the result.

- A stake without an argument is weaker than a stake with a sharp argument
- Every interaction (question, guess, injection) shapes the round's outcome
- Players are not observers -- they are **co-authors of the result**

---

## 2. Transparent Synthetic Truth

Outcomes are AI-decided, but never "magic." The AI Judge must operate under:

- public criteria,
- stable system prompt,
- and published rationales.

Every round produces a visible chain: input (scenario + actions) → reasoning → verdict → settlement. No step is hidden from participants.

## 3. Capital + Intellect = Gameplay

Money matters, but does not dominate. The design intentionally breaks "whale always wins."

- Stake influences weight, but weak logic can lose
- Smart play with small stakes can beat large uninformed bets
- This is one of the strongest differentiators and should be visible everywhere: docs, UI, onboarding, FAQs

---

## 4. High-Frequency, Infinite Events

SSE rounds should be rapid and infinitely generatable:

- no dependence on real-world schedules,
- no oracle delay,
- no content bottleneck beyond imagination.

This enables 24/7 gameplay without downtime or external dependencies.

## 5. Archive Every Universe

Each round is treated as a completed "micro-history":

- all arguments / actions,
- all stakes,
- final verdict,
- reasoning,
- settlement.

This creates:
- **Replay value** -- review past rounds for strategy
- **Transparency** -- verify any past decision
- **Long-term data value** -- aggregate patterns across rounds

# Realms (Themed Universes)

> Status: Coming Soon -- not required for MVP

---

## Concept

**Realms** are themed simulation spaces that constrain the type of scenarios, language, and narrative logic used in SSE rounds.

SSE rounds may optionally belong to a Realm. When they do, the AI Architect and AI Judge adapt tone, assumptions, and evaluation criteria accordingly.

Realms do not change core mechanics -- they change *meaning space*.

---

## Examples

| Realm | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anime Realm** | Stylized conflicts, exaggerated logic, anime tropes |
| **Finance Realm** | Synthetic markets, institutions, capital disputes |
| **Sports Realm** | Competitive scenarios, teams, rule-based outcomes |
| **Sci-Fi / Cyber Realm** | AI states, post-human conflicts, simulations |
| **Myth / Fantasy Realm** | Gods, artifacts, symbolic logic |
| **Custom / Event Realms** | Community-voted, sponsored, or seasonal themes |

---

## Rules

- All events, arguments, and adjudication logic are **contextually bound** to the selected Realm
- The AI Architect and AI Judge adapt tone, assumptions, and evaluation criteria accordingly
- Core game mechanics remain identical across Realms

---

## Design Value

- **Reduces ambiguity** -- constrains the AI's solution space
- **Increases skill** -- domain knowledge matters more
- **Encourages repeat play** across different Realms
- **Enables segmentation** -- casual vs expert players
- **Community identity** -- "Finance grinders", "Anime tacticians"
- **Opens space** for events, partnerships, and content drops

---

## Implementation Notes

Each game in the SSE ecosystem can implement Realms independently:

- **Guessing games** (Alon's Box): hidden items restricted to realm-specific vocabulary
- **Prediction rounds** (SSE): scenarios generated within realm narrative constraints
- **Future games**: realm-aware AI prompts and evaluation criteria

Realms are introduced progressively and are optional at MVP for all games.

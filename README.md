# Alon's Box

**A trustless crypto-AI guessing game on Solana.**

<div align="center">

</div>

Players deposit SOL into a program-owned escrow and compete to guess a secret answer. The answer is cryptographically committed before any deposits occur, ensuring provably fair outcomes through an on-chain commit-reveal scheme.

Built with [Anchor 0.31.1](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) | Deployed on [Solana Devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/address/J5LMxDvUSz5Agbo3bjpJZN17p4BNfqGNbrhU5vqNYrEa?cluster=devnet) | [Docs](https://simulation-theory.gitbook.io/simulation-theory-docs)

## How It Works

```
Backend commits SHA-256(answer:salt)
        |
   Round opens  -->  Players deposit SOL  -->  Round closes
        |                                           |
        v                                           v
   On-chain hash verified  <--  Backend reveals answer + salt
        |
        v
   Payouts distributed automatically via PDA escrow
```

1. **Commit** -- The backend creates a round with `SHA-256(answer:salt)` locked on-chain
2. **Deposit** -- Players deposit SOL into a program-owned Vault PDA
3. **Reveal** -- The backend reveals the plaintext answer and salt
4. **Verify** -- The contract recomputes the hash and verifies it matches the original commit
5. **Payout** -- SOL is distributed automatically: 50% winner, up to 30% evidence, 5% treasury, ~15% rollover (residual)

No one -- not even the backend -- can change the answer after players deposit. The hash is the proof.

- [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) v0.31.1
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+

### Build

```bash
# Build the on-chain program and generate IDL
anchor build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all 128 tests (spins up local validator automatically)
anchor test --skip-build

# Or via npm
npm test
```

### Deploy

```bash
solana config set --url devnet
solana program deploy target/deploy/alons_box.so
```

## Architecture

```
                    +------------------+
                    |   Backend (Auth) |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
              create_round / settle / expire
                             |
                             v
+----------+    deposit    +------------------+    payout    +----------+
|  Players | ----------->  |  Vault PDA       | ----------> |  Winner  |
+----------+               |  (SOL Escrow)    |             +----------+
                           +------------------+             |  Evidence|
                                                            +----------+
                                                            |  Treasury|
                                                            +----------+

  If authority goes offline for 24+ hours after round end:

+----------+  emergency_expire  +------------------+  buyback/rollover
|  Anyone  | -----------------> |  Vault PDA       | ----------------->
+----------+                    +------------------+
```

| PDA Account | Seeds | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `GameState` | `["game_state"]` | Global config: authority, treasury, round counter, rollover balance |
| `Vault` | `["vault"]` | Singleton SOL escrow holding all deposits |
| `Round` | `["round", round_id]` | Per-round state: commit hash, status, deposits |
| `Deposit` | `["deposit", round_id, user]` | Per-user deposit tracking |

---

## Instructions

The program exposes 8 instructions:

| Instruction | Access | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `initialize` | One-time | Set up game state and vault |
| `create_round` | Authority | Open a new round with committed answer hash |
| `deposit` | Public | Deposit SOL into an active round |
| `settle` | Authority | Resolve round with a winner, verify hash, distribute payouts |
| `expire` | Authority | End round with no winner, verify hash, distribute funds |
| `emergency_expire` | **Permissionless** | Dead man's switch — expire a round 24hrs after `ends_at` if authority is offline |
| `close_deposit` | Authority | Close a Deposit PDA after round ends, recover rent |
| `close_round` | Authority | Close a Round PDA after round ends, recover rent |

See [Instructions Reference](./docs/developers/contracts/alons-box/instructions.md) for full details.

## Payout Distribution

### Settle (winner found)

| Recipient | Share | Source | Description |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Winner | 50% | Full pool | Player who guessed correctly |
| Evidence | up to 30% | Full pool | Distributed to evidence providers |
| Treasury | 5% | Full pool | Protocol fee |
| Rollover | ~15% (residual) | Full pool | `pool - winner - evidence - treasury` |

Pool = current deposits + rollover from previous round. Rollover is computed as a **residual** (subtraction) to capture all rounding dust.

### Expire (no winner)

| Recipient | Share | Source | Description |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Buyback Wallet | 47.5% | **Deposits only** | Token buyback mechanism |
| Treasury | 5% | **Deposits only** | Protocol fee |
| Rollover added | ~47.5% (residual) | **Deposits only** | `deposits - buyback - treasury` |

Previous rollover is **fully preserved** on expire. Only current-round deposits are split. The new rollover = old rollover + rollover added.

---

## Security

- **Commit-reveal scheme** -- Answer is SHA-256 hashed before deposits; verified on-chain at settlement
- **PDA escrow** -- SOL is held by the program, not any wallet. No one can withdraw without program logic
- **Sequential round IDs** -- Prevents round skipping or replay attacks
- **Evidence cap** -- Evidence payouts hard-capped at 30% to prevent drain attacks
- **Authority checks** -- Only the designated authority can create rounds, settle, or expire
- **Buyback wallet validation** -- `expire` validates buyback wallet against `GameState.buyback_wallet`
- **Round timer enforcement** -- `create_round` validates `ends_at` is in the future
- **Emergency dead man's switch** -- Permissionless `emergency_expire` callable 24 hours after `ends_at`, prevents permanent fund lock if authority goes offline
- **Account closing** -- `close_deposit` and `close_round` recover rent from settled/expired round PDAs
- **Overflow protection** -- All arithmetic uses `checked_add` / `checked_mul`
- **On-chain events** -- All state transitions emit events for off-chain monitoring and indexing
- **Explicit rollover tracking** -- `GameState.rollover_balance` tracks the prize pool explicitly. Unsolicited vault deposits are ignored. Expire preserves the full accumulated rollover
- **Residual rounding** -- Rollover is computed as a residual (subtraction) in both settle and expire, capturing all integer-division dust
- **128 tests** -- Core flow, rollover math, balance consistency, rounding dust, multi-round accumulation, adversarial attacks (auth, replay, payout manipulation, round ID), emergency expiry, and account closing
